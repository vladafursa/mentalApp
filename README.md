Lack of support and access to it, bad quality of it, fear of opening up, feeling helpless and lost – all these problems require a solution. Sometimes even a little talk can prevent person from committing suicide and simply improve overall wellbeing. The solution to this problem can be an IOS application “Your mental health assistant” that provides track of user’s wellbeing. It is a listener for user’s feeling by providing a text field to express everything that lies on the soul. It gathers statistic on user’s happiness rate over time that will give the user insight on his mental health, provide with the opportunity to learn to take control over it and improve it. In addition, app has interactions for improving wellbeing. An app is a good choice as “health and lifestyle” category is considered the most popular mobile app category among others worldwide (Statista 2017), so it will bring attention among users. Moreover, the app is a self-tracker, so the user will not need any interactions with others, it will help to avoid shame and increase openness. The app is done with authentication, so the user will not need to be stressed about somebody else knowing personal notes inside the app. 
While the app does not carry any medical approach, there are contact details of a helpline for emergency situations.
